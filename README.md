## Description

README-generator utilizes the Node.js runtime environment to create high-quality README.md files. The content is based on responses to a series of user prompts that are captured using the NPM Inquirer package.

## Installation Instructions

### node.js installation

Make sure that you have node.js installed on your computer by entering node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. If not, try reinstalling Node.js by following this link: https://nodejs.org/en/ and clicking on the LTS version. If you are on Windows, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for Windows (x64)`. If you are using macOS, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for MacOS (x64)`

### Clone the code

Once node.js is downloaded, click on the green code button and copy the link to this repository. Then open up your favorite code editor and open the terminal. In the terminal use `cd` to go to the root directory you want this repository to be cloned to. Finally, in the terminal, type `git clone <file link>` to clone this repository to your directory.

### Inquirer

You must also install the Inquirer npm package to see the portfolio. Since Inquirer is an npm package instead of being built directly into node.js, you must type `npm init` into the command line to allow npm packages to be installed. Next, go to the app.js file, and in the command line, type `npm install inquirer` to install Inquirer on your computer. For documentation on Inquirer or other npm packages, follow this link: https://www.npmjs.com/ and type the npm you want to search in the search bar.

## Usage Instructions

When you first clone the code, you should see the same folders and code as shown below

1. To create a README, first use `cd` to navigate to the directory that README-generator is in.

2. Next, type node index into the command-line and you will be prompted with a series of questions.

3. The first question will ask for the title of the project. Enter the title of your project and press enter. Repeat this process for the rest of the questions. DO NOT PRESS ENTER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO MOVE ON. Pressing enter saves the response and returns the next question. Once the response is saved, you cannot go back and edit it, however, once the README.md file is generated, you can edit the content in your code editor.

4. Once all the questions have been answered, you should be prompted with a message that says "Your README has been successfully created!" in the command line. You can check out your new README.md in the explorer tab in your code editor and make changes if you wish.

5. When you are dont making changes, add and commit your README using `git add -A` and `git commit` and push the README to the correct repository using `git push origin main`

The finished README should look similar to the screenshot below
